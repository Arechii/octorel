# OctoRel

The motivation for this project is that GitHub's home feed only shows the new releases of your 100 most recently starred repositories, making you miss out on the others.

The experience and implementation is still work in progress, but it can be used already. A GitHub access token is required to make use of the higher ratelimits.

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm dev
```
